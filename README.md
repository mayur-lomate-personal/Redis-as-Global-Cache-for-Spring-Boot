# Redis as Global Cache for Fast retrieval for Spring Boot

This project has implemented a Spring Boot application that utilizes Redis as a global caching mechanism, significantly enhancing performance and reducing database load. By caching frequently accessed data, the application achieves faster response times and optimizes resource usage. It is structured into distinct layers, including a model layer for defining data entities, a repository layer utilizing Spring Data JPA for database interactions, a service layer for incorporating business logic and caching functionality, and a controller layer for exposing RESTful APIs. Overall, this project showcases the benefits of caching with Redis, highlighting its ability to improve data retrieval speeds and scalability while effectively demonstrating caching strategies in a real-world application.
